# Depression_Detection
A deep learning model that combines text and image data from social media timelines to detect signs of depression in users.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to detect signs of depression in social media users by analyzing their multimodal timeline data, which includes both textual posts and associated images. By modeling the sequential behavior of users over time, the system aims to identify patterns indicative of mental health struggles, particularly depression.
